# Mulligan
### “Connecting golfers around the world!”
###### Mulligan is a social media application centered around golf. This social media platform gives golfers the opportunity to connect with other golfers where they share with each other all things golf. They will have the ability to check-in to their favorite golf courses, compare handicaps with friends, and share highlights from their last round of golf. 
##### Mulligan fills a gap in the golf industry and is designed to bring the golf community together to one place, a space for just golf. This application will have similar features that many other social media applications are fitted with, but will also contain some features that are unique to golf. Some of these features include the ability to make posts to your timeline, see other users’ posts, comment on posts, and view other user’s profile pages. By giving users the ability to connect on a personal level with golfers around them, Mulligan aims to bring those people together within the golf community.
##### Mulligan also provides golf clubs and golf leagues a way to communicate with their members. For example, a golf league could create its own page on this site and post all the news/events of that league to this site as way to communicate with members. Mulligan’s goal is to reach all corners of the social aspect in the golf community to provide golfers with those connections.
